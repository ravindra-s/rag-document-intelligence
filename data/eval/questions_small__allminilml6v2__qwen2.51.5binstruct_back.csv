There was an ancient Indian town called Ayodhyâ — and it exists 
even in modern times. The province in which it is still located is 
called Oudh, and most of you may have noticed it in the map of 
India. That was the ancient Ayodhya. There, in ancient times, 
reigned a king called Dasharatha. He had three queens, but the 
king had not any children by them. And like good Hindus, the king 
and the queens, all went on pilgrimages fasting and praying, that 
they might have children and, in good time, four sons were born. 
The eldest of them was Rama. 
Now, as it should be, these four brothers were thoroughly 
educated in all branches of learning. To avoid future quarrels there 
was in ancient India a custom for the king in his own lifetime to 
nominate his eldest son as his successor, the Yuvarâja, young 
king, as he is called. 
Now, there was another king, called Janaka, and this king had a 
beautiful daughter named Sitâ. Sita was found in a field; she was a 
daughter of the Earth, and was born without parents. The word 
""Sita"" in ancient Sanskrit means the furrow made by a plough. In 
the ancient mythology of India you will find persons born of one 
parent only, or persons born without parents, born of sacrificial fire, 
born in the field, and so on — dropped from the clouds as it were.

s, worship 
Sita. The height of a woman's ambition is to be like Sita, the pure, 
the devoted, the all-suffering! When you study these characters, 
18

you can at once find out how different is the ideal in India from that 
of the West. For the race, Sita stands as the ideal of suffering. The 
West says, ""Do! Show your power by doing."" India says, ""Show 
your power by suffering."" The West has solved the problem of how 
much a man can have: India has solved the problem of how little a 
man can have. The two extremes, you see. Sita is typical of India 
— the idealised India. The question is not whether she ever lived, 
whether the story is history or not, we know that the ideal is there. 
There is no other Paurânika story that has so permeated the whole 
nation, so entered into its very life, and has so tingled in every drop 
of 
blood of the race, as this ideal of Sita. Sita is the name in India 
for everything that is good, pure and holy — everything that in 
woman we call womanly. If a priest has to bless a woman he says, 
""Be Sita!"" If he blesses a child, he says ""Be Sita!"" They are all 
children of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the patient, the 
all-suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through all this 
suffering she experiences, there is not one harsh word against 
Rama. She takes it as her own duty, and performs her own part in 
it. Think of the terrible injustice of her being exiled to the forest! But 
Sita knows no bitterness. That is, again, the Indian ideal. Says the 
ancient Buddha, ""When a man hurts you, and you turn back to hurt 
him, that would not cure the first injury; it would only create in the 
world one more wickedness."" Sita was a true Indian by nature; she 
never returned injury.

THE RAMAYANA 
(​ Delivered by ​  Swami Vivekananda​  at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, January 31, 1900​  ) 
There are two great epics in the Sanskrit language, which are very 
ancient. Of course, there are hundreds of other epic poems. The 
Sanskrit language and literature have been continued down to the 
present day, although, for more than two thousand years, it has 
ceased to be a spoken language. I am now going to speak to you of 
the two most ancient epics, called the Râmâyana and the 
Mahâbhârata. They embody the manners and customs, the state of 
society, civilisation, etc., of the ancient Indians. The oldest of these 
epics is called Ramayana, ""The Life of Râma"". There was some 
poetical literature before this — most of the Vedas, the sacred 
books of the Hindus, are written in a sort of metre — but this book 
is held by common consent in India as the very beginning of poetry. 
The name of the poet or sage was Vâlmiki. Later on, a great many 
poetical stories were fastened upon that ancient poet; and 
subsequently, it became a very general practice to attribute to his 
authorship very many verses that were not his. Notwithstanding all 
these interpolations, it comes down to us as a very beautiful 
arrangement, without equal in the literatures of the world.

Who knows which is the truer ideal? The apparent power and 
strength, as held in the West, or the fortitude in suffering, of the 
East? 
The West says, ""We minimise evil by conquering it."" India says, 
""We destroy evil by suffering, until evil is nothing to us, it becomes 
positive enjoyment."" Well, both are great ideals. Who knows which 
will survive in the long run? Who knows which attitude will really 
most benefit humanity? Who knows which will disarm and conquer 
animality? Will it be suffering, or doing? 
In the meantime, let us not try to destroy each other's ideals. We 
are both intent upon the same work, which is the annihilation of 
evil. You take up your method; let us take up our method. Let us 
not destroy the ideal. I do not say to the West, ""Take up our 
method."" Certainly not. The goal is the same, but the methods can 
never be the same. And so, after hearing about the ideals of India, I 
hope that you will say in the same breath to India, ""We know, the 
goal, the ideal, is all right for us both. You follow your own ideal. 
You follow your method in your own way, and Godspeed to you!"" 
My message in life is to ask the East and West not to quarrel over 
different ideals, but to show them that the goal is the same in both

 ""Arise, O sage! "" 
Thus aroused he exclaimed, ""Sage? I am a robber!"" ""No more 
'robber',"" answered the voice, ""a purified sage art thou. Thine old

name is gone. But now, since thy meditation was so deep and 
great that thou didst not remark even the ant-hills which surrounded 
thee, henceforth, thy name shall be Valmiki — 'he that was born in 
the ant-hill'."" So, he became a sage. 
And this is how he became a poet. One day as this sage, Valmiki, 
was going to bathe in the holy river Ganga, he saw a pair of doves 
wheeling round and round, and kissing each other. The sage 
looked up and was pleased at the sight, but in a second an arrow 
whisked past him and killed the male dove. As the dove fell down 
on the ground, the female dove went on whirling round and round 
the dead body of its companion in grief. In a moment the poet 
became miserable, and looking round, he saw the hunter. ""Thou art 
a wretch,"" he cried, ""without the smallest mercy! Thy slaying hand 
would not even stop for love!"" ""What is this? What am I saying?"" 
the poet thought to himself, ""I have never spoken in this sort of way 
before."" And then a voice came: ""Be not afraid. This is poetry that is 
coming out of your mouth. Write the life of Rama in poetic language 
for the benefit of the world."" And that is how the poem first began. 
The first verse sprang out of pits from the mouth of Valmiki, the first 
poet. And it was after that, that he wrote the beautiful Ramayana, 
""The Life of Rama"".

n it as a 
substitute for his brother. Then Rama returned to his capital, and 
by the common consent of his people he became the king of 
Ayodhya.

After Rama regained his kingdom, he took the necessary vows 
which in olden times the king had to take for the benefit of his 
people. The king was the slave of his people, and had to bow to 
public opinion, as we shall see later on. Rama passed a few 
years in happiness with Sita, when the people again began to 
murmur that Sita had been stolen by a demon and carried across 
the ocean. They were not satisfied with the former test and 
clamoured for another test, otherwise she must be banished. 
In order to satisfy the demands of the people, Sita was banished, 
and left to live in the forest, where was the hermitage of the sage 
and poet Valmiki. The sage found poor Sita weeping and forlorn, 
and hearing her sad story, sheltered her in his Âshrama. Sita was 
expecting soon to become a mother, and she gave birth to twin 
boys. The poet never told the children who they were. He brought 
them up together in the Brahmachârin life. He then composed the 
poem known as Ramayana, set it to music, and dramatised it. 
The drama, in India, was a very holy thing. Drama and music are 
themselves held to be religion. Any song — whether it be a love-
song or otherwise — if one's whole soul is in that song, one 
attains salvation, one has nothing else to do. They say it leads to 
the same goal as meditation.

There was a young man that could not in any way support his 
family. He was strong and vigorous and, finally, became a highway 
robber; he attacked persons in the street and robbed them, and 
with that money he supported his father, mother, wife, and children. 
This went on continually, until one day a great saint called Nârada 
was passing by, and the robber attacked him. The sage asked the 
robber, ""Why are you going to rob me? It is a great sin to rob 
human beings and kill them. What do you incur all this sin for?"" 
The robber said, ""Why, I want to support my family with this 
money."" 
""Now"", said the sage, ""do you think that they take a share of your 
sin also?"" ""Certainly they do,"" replied the robber. ""Very good,"" said 
the sage, ""make me safe by tying me up here, while you go home 
and ask your people whether they will share your sin in the same 
way as they share the money you make."" The man accordingly 
went to his father, and asked, ""Father, do you know how I support 
you?"" He answered, ""No, I do not."" ""I am a robber, and I kill 
persons and rob them."" ""What! you do that, my son? Get away! 
You outcast! ""He then went to his mother and asked her, ""Mother, 
do you know how I support you?"" ""No,"" she replied. ""Through 
robbery and murder."" ""How horrible it is!"" cried the mother. ""But, do 
you partake in my sin?"" said the son. ""Why should I? I never 
committed a robbery,"" answered the mother. Then, he went to his 
wife and questioned her, ""Do you know how I maintain you all?"" 
""No,"" she responded. ""Why, I am a highwayman,"" he rejoined, ""and 
for years have been robbing people; that is how I support and

Of course, there are hundreds of other epic poems. The \nSanskrit language and literature have been continued down to the \npresent day, although, for more than two thousand years, it has \nceased to be a spoken language. I am now going to speak to you of \nthe two most ancient epics, called the Râmâyana and the \nMahâbhârata. They embody the manners and customs, the state of \nsociety, civilisation, etc., of the ancient Indians. The oldest of these \nepics is called Ramayana, \"The Life of Râma\". There was some \npoetical literature before this — most of the Vedas, the sacred \nbooks of the Hindus, are written in a sort of metre — but this book \nis held by common consent in India as the very beginning of poetry. \nThe name of the poet or sage was Vâlmiki. Later on, a great many \npoetical stories were fastened upon that ancient poet; and \nsubsequently, it became a very general practice to attribute to his \nauthorship very many verses that were not his. Notwithstanding all \nthese interpolations, it comes down to us as a very beautiful \narrangement, without equal in the literatures of the world. \n1", "metadata": {"filename": "Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf", "num_pages": 21, "chunk_index": 1, "source": "D:\\Projects\\rag-document-intelligence\\data\\raw\\Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf"}}

He was strong and vigorous and, finally, became a highway \nrobber; he attacked persons in the street and robbed them, and \nwith that money he supported his father, mother, wife, and children. \nThis went on continually, until one day a great saint called Nârada \nwas passing by, and the robber attacked him. The sage asked the \nrobber, \"Why are you going to rob me? It is a great sin to rob \nhuman beings and kill them. What do you incur all this sin for?\" \nThe robber said, \"Why, I want to support my family with this \nmoney.\" \n\"Now\", said the sage, \"do you think that they take a share of your \nsin also?\" \"Certainly they do,\" replied the robber. \"Very good,\" said \nthe sage, \"make me safe by tying me up here, while you go home \nand ask your people whether they will share your sin in the same \nway as they share the money you make.\" The man accordingly \nwent to his father, and asked, \"Father, do you know how I support \nyou?\" He answered, \"No, I do not.\" \"I am a robber, and I kill \npersons and rob them.\" \"What! you do that, my son? Get away! \nYou outcast! \"He then went to his mother and asked her, \"Mother, \ndo you know how I support you?\" \"No,\" she replied. \"Through \nrobbery and murder.\" \"How horrible it is!\" cried the mother. \"But, do \nyou partake in my sin?\" said the son. \"Why should I? I never \ncommitted a robbery,\" answered the mother. Then, he went to his \nwife and questioned her, \"Do you know how I maintain you all?\" \n\"No,\" she responded. \"Why, I am a highwayman,\" he rejoined, \"and \nfor years have been robbing people; that is how I support and \n2", "metadata": {"filename": "Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf", "num_pages": 21, "chunk_index": 2, "source": "D:\\Projects\\rag-document-intelligence\\data\\raw\\Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf"}}

You are my husband, and \nit is your duty to support me.\" \nThe eyes of the robber were opened. \"That is the way of the world \n— even my nearest relatives, for whom I have been robbing, will \nnot share in my destiny.\" He came back to the place where he had \nbound the sage, unfastened his bonds, fell at his feet, recounted \neverything and said, \"Save me!

He never leaves us, for love \nnever drags down, knows no barter, no selfishness.\" \nThen the sage taught him how to worship. And this man left \neverything and went into a forest. There he went on praying and \nmeditating until he forgot himself so entirely that the ants came and \nbuilt ant-hills around him and he was quite unconscious of it.

The province in which it is still located is \ncalled Oudh, and most of you may have noticed it in the map of \nIndia. That was the ancient Ayodhya. There, in ancient times, \nreigned a king called Dasharatha. He had three queens, but the \nking had not any children by them. And like good Hindus, the king \nand the queens, all went on pilgrimages fasting and praying, that \nthey might have children and, in good time, four sons were born. \nThe eldest of them was Rama. \nNow, as it should be, these four brothers were thoroughly \neducated in all branches of learning. To avoid future quarrels there \nwas in ancient India a custom for the king in his own lifetime to \nnominate his eldest son as his successor, the Yuvarâja, young \nking, as he is called. \nNow, there was another king, called Janaka, and this king had a \nbeautiful daughter named Sitâ. Sita was found in a field; she was a \ndaughter of the Earth, and was born without parents. The word \n\"Sita\" in ancient Sanskrit means the furrow made by a plough. In \nthe ancient mythology of India you will find persons born of one \nparent only, or persons born without parents, born of sacrificial fire, \nborn in the field, and so on — dropped from the clouds as it were. \n5", "metadata": {"filename": "Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf", "num_pages": 21, "chunk_index": 5, "source": "D:\\Projects\\rag-document-intelligence\\data\\raw\\Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf"}}

The poet never told the children who they were. He brought \nthem up together in the Brahmachârin life. He then composed the \npoem known as Ramayana, set it to music, and dramatised it. \nThe drama, in India, was a very holy thing. Drama and music are \nthemselves held to be religion. Any song — whether it be a love-\nsong or otherwise — if one's whole soul is in that song, one \nattains salvation, one has nothing else to do. They say it leads to \nthe same goal as meditation. \n16", "metadata": {"filename": "Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf", "num_pages": 21, "chunk_index": 16, "source": "D:\\Projects\\rag-document-intelligence\\data\\raw\\Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf"}}

But no \nceremony in India can be performed by a married man without his \nwife: he must have the wife with him, the Sahadharmini, the \n\"co-religionist\" — that is the expression for a wife. The Hindu \nhouseholder has to perform hundreds of ceremonies, but not one \ncan be duly performed according to the Shâstras, if he has not a \nwife to complement it with her part in it. \nNow Rama's wife was not with him then, as she had been \nbanished. So, the people asked him to marry again. But at this \nrequest Rama for the first time in his life stood against the people. \nHe said, \"This cannot be. My life is Sita's.\" So, as a substitute, a \ngolden statue of Sita was made, in order that the; ceremony could \nbe accomplished. They arranged even a dramatic entertainment, to \nenhance the religious feeling in this great festival. Valmiki, the great \nsage-poet, came with his pupils, Lava and Kusha, the unknown \nsons of Rama. A stage had been erected and everything was \nready for the performance.

Then the sage said to him, \"Do not be grieved, for I will show \nyou Sita.\" Then Sita was brought upon the stage and Rama \ndelighted to see his wife. All of a sudden, the old murmur arose: \n\"The test! The test!\" Poor Sita was so terribly overcome by the \nrepeated cruel slight on her reputation that it was more than she \ncould bear. She appealed to the gods to testify to her innocence, \nwhen the Earth opened and Sita exclaimed, \"Here is the test\", and \nvanished into the bosom of the Earth.

And Rama was overwhelmed with grief. \nA few days after Sita's disappearance, a messenger came to Rama \nfrom the gods, who intimated to him that his mission on earth was \nfinished and he was to return to heaven. These tidings brought to \nhim the recognition of his own real Self. He plunged into the waters \nof Sarayu, the mighty river that laved his capital, and joined Sita in \nthe other world. \nThis is the great, ancient epic of India.

The height of a woman's ambition is to be like Sita, the pure, \nthe devoted, the all-suffering! When you study these characters, \n18\n\nyou can at once find out how different is the ideal in India from that \nof the West. For the race, Sita stands as the ideal of suffering. The \nWest says, \"Do! Show your power by doing.\" India says, \"Show \nyour power by suffering.\" The West has solved the problem of how \nmuch a man can have: India has solved the problem of how little a \nman can have. The two extremes, you see. Sita is typical of India \n— the idealised India. The question is not whether she ever lived, \nwhether the story is history or not, we know that the ideal is there. \nThere is no other Paurânika story that has so permeated the whole \nnation, so entered into its very life, and has so tingled in every drop \nof \nblood of the race, as this ideal of Sita. Sita is the name in India \nfor everything that is good, pure and holy — everything that in \nwoman we call womanly. If a priest has to bless a woman he says, \n\"Be Sita!\" If he blesses a child, he says \"Be Sita!\" They are all \nchildren of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the patient, the \nall-suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through all this \nsuffering she experiences, there is not one harsh word against \nRama. She takes it as her own duty, and performs her own part in \nit. Think of the terrible injustice of her being exiled to the forest! But \nSita knows no bitterness. That is, again, the Indian ideal. Says the \nancient Buddha, \"When a man hurts you, and you turn back to hurt \nhim, that would not cure the first injury; it would only create in the \nworld one more wickedness.\" Sita was a true Indian by nature; she \nnever returned injury. \n19", "metadata": {"filename": "Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf", "num_pages": 21, "chunk_index": 19, "source": "D:\\Projects\\rag-document-intelligence\\data\\raw\\Ramayana_Vivekananda.pdf"}}

The apparent power and \nstrength, as held in the West, or the fortitude in suffering, of the \nEast? \nThe West says, \"We minimise evil by conquering it.\" India says, \n\"We destroy evil by suffering, until evil is nothing to us, it becomes \npositive enjoyment.\" Well, both are great ideals. Who knows which \nwill survive in the long run? Who knows which attitude will really \nmost benefit humanity? Who knows which will disarm and conquer \nanimality? Will it be suffering, or doing? \nIn the meantime, let us not try to destroy each other's ideals. We \nare both intent upon the same work, which is the annihilation of \nevil. You take up your method; let us take up our method. Let us \nnot destroy the ideal. I do not say to the West, \"Take up our \nmethod.\" Certainly not. The goal is the same, but the methods can \nnever be the same. And so, after hearing about the ideals of India, I \nhope that you will say in the same breath to India, \"We know, the \ngoal, the ideal, is all right for us both.
